================================Detailed Explanation of Erros and Its solution================================
1.when i created a rails project(in my case) :
	
	commmand applied : rails new simple_cms -d postgresql
	

Error : An error occurred while installing pg (1.2.3), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install pg -v '1.2.3' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling.

In Gemfile:
  pg
         run  bundle binstubs bundler
Could not find gem 'pg (~> 1.1)' in rubygems repository https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally.
The source does not contain any versions of 'pg'
       rails  webpacker:install
Could not find gem 'pg (~> 1.1)' in rubygems repository https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally.
The source does not contain any versions of 'pg'
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.

	solution : 1. run :	sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
	           2. run :	bundle install // bcs project already created no need to create again simple install webpacker as shown below
		   3. run :	rails webpacker:install
		   4. run : 	rails server // it will start running
2.
