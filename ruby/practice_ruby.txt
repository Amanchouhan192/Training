1. Object oriented programming language:

    Data Encapsulation
    Data Abstraction
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance


3.variable :

	1.Local variable: define in a methods,not available outside the methods,begine with lowercase letter or '_'
	2.instance variable:available across the methods for any particular instance that means instance variable change object to object.
					denoted like : @variablename
	3.class variable:Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a cl                        ass. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.
	4.global variable: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes,				 you need to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).


2.Methods:
 
how to define :

 class Sample
    def hello                     #this is the definition of a methods. 
        puts "method learning"
    end
end                               #termination of class.

object  = Sample. new
object.hello

output : ruby classcust.rb
method learning


3.Methods and class 

$global_variable = 10
class Class1
  def print_global
    puts "Global variable in class 1 is #$global_variable"
  end
end

class Class2
  def print_global
    puts "Global variable in class 2 #$global_varible is #$global_variable"
  end
end

class1Object = Class1.new
class1Object.print_global
class2Object = Class2.new
class2Object.print_global
