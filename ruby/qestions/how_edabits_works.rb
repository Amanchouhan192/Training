How Edabit Works (very easy)

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

def hello()

end

All you have to do is type return "hello edabit.com" on the second line and then click the Check button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL. Click it and see what happens.
Notes

    The return statement is optional.
    The returned string must be in all lowercase letters.
    If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
    If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.



=end 

def hello()
  return "hello edabit.com"
end
